# Self-Driving-Car
A self-driving car, also known as an autonomous vehicle, driverless car, or robotic car, is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input. 

A project that trains a virtual car to how to move an object around a screen (drive itself) without running into obstacles using a type of reinforcement learning called Q-Learning. 

# Dependencies
* Numpy (http://www.numpy.org/)
* Pygame. I used these instructions: http://askubuntu.com/questions/401342/how-to-download-pygame-in-python3-3 but with pip3 install hg+http://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame after I installed the dependencies
* Pymunk. Use Pymunk 4. Using version 5 will not work as it was a major refactor. V4 is here
* Keras pip3 install keras
* Theanos pip3 install git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git --upgrade --no-deps
* h5py pip3 install h5py

Use pip to install any missing dependencies
